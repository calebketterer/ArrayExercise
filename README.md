# ArrayExercise

This simple program uses a 2 Dimensional array 
to organize chess variant pieces and then 
return which pieces belong to which factions.

The first of the two arrays is the faction number, 
the second is the piece in the order:

King and Queen
Rook
Knight
Bishop
Pawn

Using RNG, the user can instead substitute a 
specific search for (-1,-1), which 
returns a random piece's data.
